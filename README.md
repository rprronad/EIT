Command Line Test is a tool based on BASH shell scripting designed to replicate an online testing environment with simulated login functionality. Users are prompted to sign in using predefined credentials. Upon successful authentication, the tool presents questions sourced from an existing database. It also manages potential errors such as timeouts and records user-provided answers for later review.

In today's educational landscape, numerous online platforms facilitate remote testing with comprehensive interfaces, backend databases for questions, and automated evaluation capabilities. These platforms often include features like timed assessments, detailed reporting, and user-friendly interfaces. This project aims to emulate such functionalities using Linux Shell Scripting techniques, leveraging constructs like loops, pattern matching commands (e.g., grep, sed), and file management operations (e.g., permissions, directories). Implementing this project will provide beginners with practical experience in shell scripting and handling various aspects of system operations.
